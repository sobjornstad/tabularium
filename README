Tabularium is a Qt application for maintaining personal indexes, the successor
to the RPPAS (Records Project Paper Augmentation System).

It is currently in alpha; it should work, but there are some rough edges. If
you spot a bug that isn't listed in meta/TODO in the source code, please feel
free to report it. However, I cannot guarantee support for the software in its
current state.

There is no upgrade procedure from RPPAS, but if you were previously using
RPPAS and have a database from there, email me a copy
(`contact@sorenbjornstad.com`) and I can manually convert it for you.

See `docs/manual.md` for details on how to use Tabularium; I haven't gotten
around to making a quick start wizard for new users, so you'll likely need to
take a look at it to figure out what to do.


Installation
============

There are no builds available currently; you'll need to install from source.
You will need Python 3, Qt 5, pyuic5, and pyrcc5 (available in any good package
repository), and the Python modules passlib and python-magic (available through
pip3). You'll also want unittest and nosetests if you'd like to run the
automated test suite.

Before running Tabularium, you need to build the UI from the XML descriptions.
This can be done by running `designer/makeForms.sh`. After that, you should be
set to start Tabularium by running `./tabularium`.

If you want Tabularium to warn you about entries you're creating that may be
misspelled versions of existing ones, you need to download and install the
SQLite edit-distance extensions by running `make` in the Tabularium directory.

If you'd like Tabularium to be available system-wide, you can place the entire
directory anywhere convenient and then create a symlink to the `tabularium`
executable in `/usr/bin/`.
