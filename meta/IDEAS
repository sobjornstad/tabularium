These are things that could be added AFTER things that are in the interface to
be taken care of are implemented...

* Some way to mark an entry/occurrence as bogus, to edit it later?
* A way to look up BACKWARDS: that is, find entries that have a given occurrence. (Basically the simplification printout, only not on paper.)
* A filter box for the sources tree.



POSSIBLE BUGS:
SELECT * FROM occurrences WHERE eid NOT IN (SELECT eid FROM entries);
This should definitely not return anything, I got it to a while ago; might be in the adding routine? IT was a new entry.
