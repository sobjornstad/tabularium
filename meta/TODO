BUGS:
- When saving a new source, super isn't called (when you click 'add')
- Edit -> Prefs causes a KeyError on empty database
- "Values" label in Add Occurrences window is unhelpful
- "wash" should work if the sort key field is empty
- Similarly, if the sort key is empty when clicking add assume it's the same as the name
- Double-click on source/volume to edit it
- Reconsider default for valid references? Mama thought 1-1 was stupid. Maybe a warning if you do choose that is the best course.
- Filtering out a single OID doesn't work right for nearby, as there could be another occurrence of the same entry nearby which then causes it to show up
- Regex search is not enabled when starting the program even if the checkbox's state is restored to checked

MAJOR THINGS TO ADD:
- Check for LaTeX before allowing the user to print, to avoid wacky errors
- Copy text of entry/occ/etc. option?
- Implement status bar notification of limits, and correct sizing and saving of size of newly splittered limits pane
- Undo
- Consistify text
- Database check, or actual SQL constraints
- Tpeek doesn't respect the password option, and it isn't actually saved anywhere
- Passlib is a dependency that I was unaware of, should be included / listed in deps document
- Limits needs to be shrunk or made collapsible for the benefit of users with smaller screens than me (or for when I'm on Karina!)
- Help button in UOF?

REFACTORING:
- Func to get UOF from occurrences

SUGGESTIONS:
* A more friendly option (tab?) for adding occurrences if you haven't figured out UOF yet
* Multiple-add
* Autocomplete in entry boxes
* "What links here?" -- backwards redirect
* Consider doing away with the "inspect" menu; it may be possible to move everything there somewhere else.
* A way to look up BACKWARDS: that is, find entries that have a given occurrence. (Basically the simplification printout, only not on paper.)
* "Standard Abbreviations" feature: a list in the program, and warn if trying to search or add an entry with the full pattern. As with, say, autocorrect or vim abbreviations, this could be used for things that aren't actually abbreviations but more of simply synonyms.
* Fuzzy match to warn on similar entries/at least spelling errors?
* Flymake-style validation of UOF, and maybe checking of above for entries
* Email indexing
* Limit to *nK* matches -- option next to inc/regex for speed?
* Make it possible to change source types (e.g., switch to a different diary source)
* Allow moving using "merge" and merging using "edit"
* SQLite full-text search?

SUGGESTED TOOLS:
* Duplicates Tool
* Entry Merge Tool
* Invalid Redirect Check
* Mass Deletion Tool
* Proper Name Conflict Tool
* Sort Check Tool
