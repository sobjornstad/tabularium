BUGS:

MAJOR THINGS TO ADD:
- Manual
- Undo
- Consistify text
- User-specified date format
- Database check

REFACTORING:
- Use nearbySpread in that buggy isNearby
- Func to get UOF from occurrences
- SQLite full-text search?

SUGGESTIONS:
* Multiple-add
* Autocomplete in entry boxes
* "What links here?" -- backwards redirect
* Consider doing away with the "inspect" menu; it may be possible to move everything there somewhere else.
* A way to look up BACKWARDS: that is, find entries that have a given occurrence. (Basically the simplification printout, only not on paper.)
* "Standard Abbreviations" feature: a list in the program, and warn if trying to search or add an entry with the full pattern. As with, say, autocorrect or vim abbreviations, this could be used for things that aren't actually abbreviations but more of simply synonyms.
* Fuzzy match to warn on similar entries/at least spelling errors?
* Flymake-style validation of UOF, and maybe checking of above for entries
* Email indexing
* Limit to *nK* matches -- option next to inc/regex for speed?
* Make it possible to change source types (e.g., switch to a different diary source)
* Allow moving using "merge" and merging using "edit"

SUGGESTED TOOLS:
* Duplicates Tool
* Entry Merge Tool
* Invalid Redirect Check
* Mass Deletion Tool
* Proper Name Conflict Tool
* Sort Check Tool
