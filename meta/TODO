BUGS:
- Check that the view is properly updated when returning from all dialogs
- You can't select a source in occurrence limits
- Percent signs in entries are handled incorrectly due to searching

MAJOR THINGS TO ADD:
- Implement the limit-occurrences feature.
- Tools?
- Multiple-add
- Manual
- Export
- Undo
- Consistify text
- About window


SUGGESTIONS:
* Autocomplete in entry boxes
* "What links here?" -- backwards redirect
* Consider doing away with the "inspect" menu; it may be possible to move everything there somewhere else.
* A way to look up BACKWARDS: that is, find entries that have a given occurrence. (Basically the simplification printout, only not on paper.)
* "Standard Abbreviations" feature: a list in the program, and warn if trying to search or add an entry with the full pattern. As with, say, autocorrect or vim abbreviations, this could be used for things that aren't actually abbreviations but more of simply synonyms.
* Fuzzy match to warn on similar entries/at least spelling errors?
* Flymake-style validation of UOF, and maybe checking of above for entries
* Reconsider UOF, both the format and the parsing thereof. It has not turned out all that well, unfortunately. Braces kind of suck to type and are often not actually necessary for clarity, despite covering tons of corner cases things that look obvious to a person still aren't handled properly...etc. Oh, and the parser is like 400 lines of spaghetti code.
* Email indexing
* Limit to *nK* matches -- option next to inc/regex for speed?
