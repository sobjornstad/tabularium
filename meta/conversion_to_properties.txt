ENTRIES

_name getName setName ==> name
_eid getEid setEid    ==> eid
_sk getSk setSortKey  ==> sortKey
_clf getClassification setClassification ==> classification
_da getDadded ---     ==> dateAdded
_de getDedited ---    ==> dateEdited

Also wipe out getOccurrences() -- replace with db.occurrences.fetchForEntry

OCCURRENCES
-----------

_ref getRef!! setRef         ==> ref
_type getRef!! setRef        ==> reftype
_entry getEntry setEntry     ==> entry
_volume getVolume setVolume  ==> volume
_da getAddedDate             ==> dateAdded
_de getEditedDate            ==> dateEdited
_oid getOid                  ==> oid

getRef: stop using this dumb combinatorial tuple thing
dump: change to flush
getOccsOfEntry: this is used in exactly one place in ui/main.py, except for in tests -- try refactoring it out of existence

SOURCES

_name getName setName                     ==> name
_volval getVolVal setValidVol             ==> volVal
_pageval getPageVal setValidPage          ==> pageVal

_sid getSid ---                           ==> sid

Does delete really need to execute its own SQL query?
dump -> _flush
deletePreview -> previewDelete

VOLUMES
-------

_num getNum setNum              ==> num
_notes getNotes setNotes        ==> notes
_dopened getDopened setDopened  ==> dateOpened
_dclosed getDclosed setDclosed  ==> dateClosed
_source getSource ---           ==> source
_vid getVid ---                 ==> vid

getFormattedDopened/closed - search and destroy, should be in ui even ("f)
dump->flush

findNextDopened -> findNextDateOpened
